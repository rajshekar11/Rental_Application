It provides a set of REST API endpoints that handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing rental properties and bookings. The application is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

## Tech Stack

- Core Java: The programming language used for building the application logic.
- Spring Framework: An open-source framework that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications.
- Spring Boot: A framework that simplifies the setup and configuration of Spring applications, providing a faster and easier development experience.
- Spring Security: A powerful authentication and authorization framework that secures the application and ensures the privacy of user data.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is used for authentication and validation of tenants.
- Spring Data JPA: A part of the Spring Framework that makes it easy to implement JPA (Java Persistence API) repositories, providing convenient access to the database.
- Hibernate: An object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies the interaction with the database and provides efficient data persistence.
- MySQL: A popular relational database management system used for storing and retrieving data in a structured manner.
- Postman: A popular collaboration platform for API development and testing.
